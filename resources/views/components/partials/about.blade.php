    <h2 class="main-title">About Me</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Abderrazzak Lakhtyari</strong>, a passionate <strong>Full Stack Web Developer</strong> with
            expertise in both frontend and backend technologies. I specialize in creating seamless, dynamic, and
            responsive web applications that deliver exceptional user experiences.</p>

        <p>With a solid foundation in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, I
            bring websites to life with clean, semantic code. I leverage the power of <strong>React</strong> to build
            interactive, scalable user interfaces, ensuring performance and usability across all devices. On the
            backend, I work with <strong>PHP</strong> and the <strong>Laravel</strong> framework to build robust,
            efficient applications, while integrating databases to ensure smooth data management.</p>

        <p>My approach to development is always user-centric, focusing on clean design, intuitive navigation, and
            performance optimization. I am a strong advocate for <strong>responsive design</strong> and
            <strong>mobile-first</strong> principles, ensuring that every application I build looks and functions
            beautifully on any screen size.</p>

        <p>I’m always looking to learn new technologies, solve complex challenges, and contribute to meaningful
            projects. Whether you need a personal website, an e-commerce platform, or a full-scale web application, I’m
            here to help bring your vision to life.</p>
